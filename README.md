TypewriterJS
===================

TypewriterJS is a simple JavaScript library that creates a console typing effect by calling a simple function.

>**How to use:**
>
> - Create an empty `<span>` element and wrap it with whatever element you need. E.g.: `<h1>`, `<p>` etc.
> - Give your `<span>` an **id** attribute: `<span id="type-box"></span>`
> - Call the following function: `typeWritter('type-box', 'Hello World!', 300);`

> typeWriter(spanId, text, time);

> The *first argument* is the **id attribute** of the span where we want the text to be typed in.

> The *second argument* is the **text** that we want to be typed.

> The *third argument* is the **speed** -in milliseconds- that takes for a new letter to be typed.
